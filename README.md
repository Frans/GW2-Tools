# GW2-Tools
This project has as first goal to provide continues market data from the GuildWars 2 Trading Post. While there are other 
websites that allow you to access and analyze market data, they store and collect all the data, and as such are slower and 
can have data that is over 30 minutes old.

This webpage runs completly clientside on Javascript, and connects directly to the GW2 api every minute to retrieve your desired
data. This means non of the data is being stored, it is here to provide a live dashbpard.
